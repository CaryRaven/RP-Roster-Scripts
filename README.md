# Blackshadow Roster Scripts
This repo contains all the Google Apps Script code regarding the rosters (google spreadsheets) of SCP: Project Blackshadow.
This large project is my first contribution to the world of programming, hence why some code might be unoptimized or not following certain conventions. I'm only a beginner trying to learn and this codebase will be (at least for now) consitently updated over time.

Feel free to help me out by giving suggestions or making pull requests.

The codebase, as of right now, is poorly documented as you can tell by this short readme. I haven't felt the time or the courage to properly start documenting everything. Though this will have to happen someday, so stay tuned for that or, if you want, you can even help me out!
